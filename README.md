## Model and code description

### ***Model objects***

Cells occupy contiguous sets of points in a square lattice of size
($N_{x} \times N_{y}$). Each cell is prescribed a unique id, recorded in
matrix $\mathbf{I}$ ($N_{x} \times N_{y}$). Further, each cell is
prescribed a cell type (e.g. ES, TS, XEN), entailing unique, pre-defined
cellular properties. Cell type is immutable, establishing a mapping
between the cell index $i$ and its cell type $c_{i} = \{ 1,2,..\}$.
Lattice points that are unoccupied by a cell define the medium, given an
id $i = 0$ and $c_{0} = 0$.

### **Energy functional**

The simulation evolves via a stochastic minimization of an energy
function that accounts for both differential affinity and other physical
properties of cells. The energy functional was defined as below:

![](figs/eq1.png)

$\lambda_{A,i}$ describes the bulk modulus of area deformations of a
cell $i$ from its optimum $A_{i,0}$. $\lambda_{P,i}$ defines its
circumferential elastic modulus of the perimeter, scaling a
contractility term ($P_{i}^{2}$) and the tension of interfaces between
cells and the media ($\kappa b_{i}$ where $b_{i}$ is the number of Moore
neighbors of cell $i$ that are medium). The final term accounts for
adhesion/tension with neighboring cells: $\omega_{i}$ is the set of
lattice points 
$x, y$ 
that the cell occupies; $\Omega$ is the Moore
neighborhood; meaning $I_{x + dx,y + dy}$ is the cell id of a lattice
point that neighbors a point within the cell; $J_{i,I_{x + dx,y + dy}}$
defines the strength of the interaction between cell $i$ and the
neighboring cell; and $\lambda_{T}$ is a scale-factor across all
adhesion terms. $\mathbf{J}$ is a symmetric matrix
($n_{c} + 1 \times n_{c} + 1$) of pairwise interaction strengths.
Interactions must be between different cells, meaning
$J_{ii} = 0\ \forall i$.

The matrix $\mathbf{I}$ defines the area and perimeters of each cell.
The area $A_{i}$ of cell $i$ is defined as the number of lattice point
that cell $i$ occupies, i.e.:

![](figs/eq2.png)

Likewise, the perimeter $P_{i}$ of cell $i$ is the number of lattice
points that are: (i) members of the Moore neighborhood of the lattice
points of cell 
$i$
(i.e. $ \omega_{i} $); but (ii) are not themselves
members of the cell 
$i$.

### **Bootstrapping procedure**

We parameterized adhesion strengths using cohesion forces between pairs
of cell-types that were directly measured by AFM. For each simulation,
we sampled this distribution to build the $\mathbf{J}$ matrix.
Specifically, for a given element $J_{ij}$ we sample (with replacement)
the set of AFM cohesion forces measured between cell-types 
$c_{i}$ 
and
$c_{j}$
(e.g. ES-ES, ES-TS,...), while enforcing symmetry in the
$\mathbf{J}$ matrix. We set entries between cells and the medium
($J_{0j,}{\ J}_{i0}$) to 0. Bootstrap sampling is performed \~500 times
to establish an ensemble of $\mathbf{J}$ matrix samples. Each
$\mathbf{J}$ matrix sample is used to perform a CPM simulation,
generating an ensemble distribution of conformations over time.

AFM adhesion measurements are stored in this repository in a .json file in *raw_data*. To repeat the bootstrapping, run

### `python run_scripts/make_adhesion_matrices.py`

### **Simulation algorithm**

The CPM evolves via a stochastic minimization. In each Markov Chain Step
(MCS), a random lattice site is selected. One of the four sites in the
Von Neumann neighborhood is then selected and the state of the chosen
site is putatively reassigned to that of its neighbor. The energy
functional is then evaluated before and after the swap, defining
$\Delta E$. The swap is then accepted only if:

![](figs/eq3.png)

As with the lattice model, $T$ defines the effective temperature of the
system, modulating the propensity to perform energetically unfavorable
swaps. In traditional CPM simulations, cell Moore contiguity breaks down
at high $T$ given swapping rules are local. Consequently, we universally
reject potential state changes that compromise contiguity, following Durand & Guesnet (Computer Physics Communications, 2016). 

The full CPM code is housed within the module *CPM*. This contains a main class in the *cpm.py* file, involved in initialising 
and running simulations. This runs of a *sample* class in the *sample.py* file, performing the Metropolis-Hastings optimization
under the energy functional prescribed above. Further, the maintenance of contiguity is achieved with reference to the class in *zmasks.py*. 

Running simulations for a given bootstrap sample of the adhesion values can be done in the command-line. 
For example for the bootstrap sample '72' (or any other), one can run. 

### `python run_scripts/run_bootstrap.py 72`

This additionally runs a scrambled control, where cell-types and adhesion values are independent of one another. 


## ***Automated scoring of conformations***

To determine the conformation of a simulated structure at a given
time-point, we established an automated scoring procedure. Firstly, we
remove cells that have detached from the main aggregate by calculating
the adjacency matrix between cells (Moore neighborhood) and removing all
clusters besides the one with the largest number of connected
components. Secondly, we score each cell-type for envelopment. A
cell-type is defined to be enveloping if its center of mass lies within
a different cell-type, rather than that of its own. Thirdly, we score
cell-type contiguity by calculating the subgraph of the connectivity
matrix that contains only cells of a given type, then determining
whether the number of connected components is 1 (i.e. contiguous). With
three cell-types, there are 16 possible completely sorted conformations.
These conformations can be divided into 4 categories.

In category (1) conformations, two cell types sequentially envelope a
third. The order of envelopment is determined via adjacency among
cell-types. For example, when E envelopes X which envelopes T: at least
one X must contact T; at least one E must contact the medium; at least
one E must contact X; and no E should contact T. Further, the inner most
cell-type must be contiguous.

In category (2), one cell type envelopes another, with a third attached
peripherally; whereas in category (3) one cell type envelopes the other
two (as in ETX embryos). Both categories must contain two contiguous
cell-types and a third enveloping cell-type. If all cells of the
enveloping cell-type contact the medium, the conformation is scored to
category (3). If any of the cells that do not contact the medium are
instead surrounded by a single cell-type, the conformation is scored as
'unsorted'. Alternatively, if any of these cells contact exactly two
other cell-types, then the conformation falls in category (2). Which
variant within category (2) is determined by counting the number of
contacts (e.g. X envelopes E rather than T if X and E share more
contacts than X and T). Otherwise, the conformation is assigned category
(3).

Category (4) is assigned when all three cell-types are non-enveloping
and are contiguous. If a given structure does not fall within any of
these categories, it is classed as 'unsorted'.

Additionally, we define cell externalization: if all cells of that type
either contact the medium directly, or are connected to cells that are
connected to the medium. Strictly, we define the subgraph of the
adjacency matrix containing the rows and columns of a given cell-type
plus the medium; if this subgraph has a single connected component, then
the cell-type is externalized.

Analysis scripts are found in *analysis_scripts*. *run_analysis.py* runs the above conformation analysis, 
plus other topological analyses described in the paper, for a given bootstrap value. For example, for bootstrap 72, 
one can run

### `python analysis_scripts/run_analysis.py 72`


## ***Lower stiffness in XEN cells improves the speed and fidelity of their externalization***

We used the CPM to determine whether reduced stiffness in XEN cells can
explain the robustness of their externalization *in silico*. We
systematically altered the stiffness of XEN cells by varying the
circumferential elastic modulus of XEN cells $\lambda_{P}^{XEN}$ between
0.04 and 0.20 (9 values simulated). This parameter ascribes the extent
of the circumferential energy penalty, meaning a cell with a higher
values of $\lambda_{P}^{XEN}$ resists deformations to its perimeter more
i.e. is stiffer.

Code to run these parameter scans can be found in *run_scripts/run_soft_stiff.py*.
